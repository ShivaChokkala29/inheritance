# inheritance I have created java project which tells about the inheritance properities.
it consists of 4 classes(hospitalemployee,nurse,doctor,surgeon) and one class(hospital.java) with main code which invokes other classes as objects are created here.
hospitalemployee is an parent class for nurse and doctor and surgeon is a child  class of doctor class.
work method is overridden in each classes.
